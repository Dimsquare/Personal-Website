      ## I am an enthusiastic and diligent individual currently progressing
      towards completing my AS Level. In the course of my studies, I am engaged
      in a project focused on developing a program designed to predict the
      GBP/USD exchange rate. This endeavour, along with my participation in
      various enriching activities, has significantly developed my leadership,
      teamwork, and networking abilities as well as confidence and presentation
      skills. Notable experiences include participation in the InvestIn
      engineering program, the Space Design competition, Model United Nations,
      TedX Talks, multiple lectures and virtual work experiences through
      Springpod. I am actively seeking work experience opportunities in the
      field of Computer Science to further cultivate my strong interest in
      science and lay the groundwork for a future career in Data Science.

    text: "# Work Observation, Simmons Coopers Partners, Lagos, Nigeria\n\n(2022)\n\n*   During my time at Simmons Coopers Partners, I had the opportunity to observe the daily operations of lawyers and gain first-hand experience of office dynamics. This experience notably enhanced my public speaking skills, as I delivered a presentation on the intersection of technology and law. This sparked my interest in the broader implications of technology across various economic sectors, leading me to explore how technological advancements influence different fields.\n\n\_\n\n# Work Observation, Barclays Bank, London\n\n(26\\<sup>th\\</sup>\_October 2023)\n\n*   My observation at Barclays Bank offered me a practical insight into the workings of an office environment, specifically within investment banking. I learned about the application of data science in banking and gained a deeper understanding of technology's significant impact on the finance sector. Interacting with employees at the bank further developed my communication skills, providing me with valuable professional networking experience.\n\n\_\n\n# Work Observation, UCL, London\n\n*(19\\<sup>th\\</sup>\_– 23\\<sup>rd\\</sup>\_February 2024)*\n\n*   In my role at University College London (UCL), I had the privilege of enhancing my programming expertise through hands-on experience, under the guidance of a PhD student in Palaeontology. This opportunity not only introduced me to the R programming language, expanding my skill set beyond Python and other general-purpose languages, but also offered me a glimpse into university life and the professional world beyond academia. I learned to adapt to the standard work hours in a professional environment, honing my time management skills. The culmination of this experience was a presentation delivered to my supervisor and career advisor, significantly improving my confidence and presentation abilities.\n\n"
